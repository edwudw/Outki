# Outki
An instant messenger project that is designed to be a proper alternative to Windows Live Messenger.

Plans:

1. Private chatting
2. Logins (username and passwords)
3. Encryption
4. Group chats
5. File Transfers
6. VoIP

Q: Why not just use Skype or another alternative?
A: There are thousands of alternatives to Skype, but none of them are open source, and most of them don't have the number of features that Skype has. Skype itself tends to be full of bugs and because it isn't open source, we're not even sure whether it does use encryption or if there are any backdoors, or how much data governments collect from it.
